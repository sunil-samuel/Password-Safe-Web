# Web Interface

Once the application is bootstrapped, it will print out URLs that the application is listening on.  Use any browser (IE, Mozilla, Chrome, ...) to access this page.

<pre><small>
&gt; java -jar target/password-safe-webapp-&lt;version&gt;.jar --dbDir ~/databases/newdb
Please enter a password for database:<i><b>&lt;password&gt;</b></i>
Server starting (try these URLs):
	http://192.168.0.103:8080
	http://localhost:8080
</small></pre>

## Authentication

Once the application is executed for the first time, it will initialize the database created with a user name and password that will be used to access this user interface for the first time.  This user has full authorization to the system, therefore change the password once you log onto the system.  This username and password are:

```
Username: admin@passwordsafeweb.com
Password: mypassword
```

The interface is as follows:

## Home Page (Admin)

The application will create a default `Category` and `Entry`.  Since the first user that the application creates has an authorization role of *admin* user, you should update the password and create additional users, using the `Admin` menu item.

The application uses a role-based system to authorize the different users into the system.  This means that the admin can determine what type of access a user has into the system.  There are three roles as follows:

* **Admin** - The user has full access to this system.  The user can add, update, and delete categories and entries in addition to modifying the users.
* **ReadWrite** - The user can add, update, and delete categories and entries.
* **ReadOnly** - The user can only view categories and entries but cannot change anything.

## Category (Group)

A Category is a directory hierarchy that can hold several entries.  A category can have sub-categories similar to a directory on a file system.  Name a category according to the entries it will hold, such as 'Credit Cards', 'YouTube', 'Facebook', 'Personal', ....

<img src="/documentation/gfx/categories.png" border="1">

Use the menu item 'Category' to create, delete, update, and view categories.

<img src="/documentation/gfx/category-menu.png" border="1">

Create as many categories and sub-categories as you need so that you can group your entries accordingly using the Menu &rarr; Category &rarr; New Entry link.  At a minimum, provide a 'title' for the category and you can start to add entries into it.
