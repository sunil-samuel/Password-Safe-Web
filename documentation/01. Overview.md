# Overview

The **Password Safe Web** is a safe and secure web-based password manager that runs within the confinements of your firewall within your residence or work.

One of the biggest issues with the existing password managers (such as KeePass or Password Safe (pwsafe)) is that these are standalone applications that must run from a single machine.  But it is not easy to access this information from another device within your own home, such as from a tablet or phone or even another computer.  There are other password managers that are hosted externally to your firewall, which is a potential risk that most do not want to take.

The **Password Safe Web** is written in Java and uses Jetty to quickly and easily standup the web server.  This means that you can start this application on any machine that has Java installed and access the application from other internal machines.  The **Password Safe Web** encrypts the database and is only accessible using a two-phase password system.

## Features

1. **Platform Independent** - The application can run on any environment that has Java installed.
2. **Embedded Web Server** - The application runs as a normal Java application without having to install a web-server.
3. **Secure Web** - The application runs on an internal IP address and is not visible to users outside of your home (unless if you allow).
4. **Two Phase Access** - Even though the application is hosted inside your home firewall, the application requires two phases of password.  The first one is a HTTP Basic Authentication and the other a username and password.
5. **Encrypted Database** - The database that is created is password protected and encrypted using Blowfish/CBC/NoPadding encryption algorithm.
6. **I18n** - The application is written to support every language.  Currently, the application supports English, German, and Malayalam.  The application can be easily extended to support other languages since it uses the Spring MVC i18n via property files, therefore extending is simple.
7. **Movable Database** - The database can be easily moved to another machine and other platforms without having to run any complex migration process.  You can simply copy the database directory to the new machine and start the application (see Usage)
